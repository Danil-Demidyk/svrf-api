# Getting Started with the SVRF API

SVRF's API allows you to supercharge your project or app with the first and largest search engine for immersive experiences. We make it dead simple for any developer to incorporate highly immersive experiences with all kinds of applications: virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, mobile, and web.

The SVRF API is based on REST principles, allowing you to integrate it cross-platform. Our endpoints return responses in [JSON][]. We support [CORS][], allowing you to access immersive experiences indexed by SVRF on your web domain. We provide a variety of resolutions, projections, and file formats to support most modern clients.

SVRF API Documentation is available at [developers.svrf.com][SVRF Dev].

## Access and API Keys

The SVRF API is currently in private beta and access is currently limited to select partners. If youâ€™re interested in using the SVRF API for your app or project, please contact us at api@svrf.com. We cannot guarantee immediate access for all requests, but we will announce a public release in the coming months.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at api@svrf.com. Please submit API corrections via [GitHub Issues][]. Please see our [terms of service][TOS] for any restrictions on using the service.
