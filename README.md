# Getting Started with the SVRF API

SVRF's API allows you to supercharge your project or app with the first and largest search engine for immersive experiences. We make it dead simple for any developer to incorporate highly immersive experiences with all kinds of applications: virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, mobile, and web.

The SVRF API is based on REST principles, allowing you to integrate it cross-platform. Our endpoints return responses in [JSON]. We support [CORS], allowing you to access immersive experiences indexed by SVRF on your web domain. We provide a variety of resolutions, projections, and file formats to support most modern clients.

SVRF API Documentation is available at [developers.svrf.com].

## Access and API Keys

The SVRF API is currently in private beta and access is currently limited to select partners. If youâ€™re interested in using the SVRF API for your app or project, please contact us at api@svrf.com. We cannot guarantee immediate access for all requests, but we will announce a public release in the coming months.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at api@svrf.com. Please submit API corrections via [GitHub issues]. Please see our [terms of service] for any restrictions on using the service.

## API Highlights

[The SVRF Search Endpoint] brings the power of immersive search found on SVRF.com to your app or project. SVRF's search engine enables your users to instantly find the immersive experience they're seeking. Content is sorted by the SVRF rating system, ensuring that the highest quality content and most prevalent search results are returned.

[The SVRF Trending Endpoint] provides your app or project with the hottest immersive content curated by real humans. The experiences returned mirror the SVRF homepage, from timely cultural content to trending pop-culture references. The trending experiences are updated regularly to ensure users always get fresh updates of immersive content.
