# Getting Started

SVRF's API allows you to supercharge your project or app with the first and largest search engine for immersive experiences. We make it dead simple for any developer to incorporate highly immersive experiences with all kinds of applications: virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, mobile, and web.

The SVRF API is based on REST principles, allowing you to integrate it cross-platform. Our endpoints return responses in [JSON][]. We support [CORS][], allowing you to access immersive experiences indexed by SVRF on your web domain. We provide a variety of resolutions, projections, and file formats to support most modern clients.

SVRF API Documentation is available at [https://developers.svrf.com][SVRF Dev].
